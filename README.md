# Arduino library for MERG CBUS running over CAN bus

Together with the other CBUS libraries, it provides everything required to implement a FLiM CBUS module that can be configured using FCU or JMRI.

This library contains an abstract base class that must be implemented by a concrete subclass, depending on the processor and CAN controller to be used, e.g. CBUS2515, CBUSESP32, etc.
